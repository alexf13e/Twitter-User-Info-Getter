# Twitter-User-Info-Getter
Takes in a list of twitter user IDs and outputs their handle, display name, description and links

Program made for a friend who wanted to archive info about people they follow on Twitter before its seemingly inevitable demise,
so they can continue find them elsewhere

# Example Input
I believe they got this from a load of data you can find by requesting data twitter holds about you. I don't actually use twitter so idk...
```
[
  {
    "following" : {
      "accountId" : "16747981",
      "userLink" : "https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=16747981"
    }
  },
  {
    "following" : {
      "accountId" : "18106205",
      "userLink" : "https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=18106205"
    }
  },
  {
    "following" : {
      "accountId" : "55793637",
      "userLink" : "https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=55793637"
    }
  }
]
```

# Example Output
These are just ones I found in their list that didn't seem too "unsavoury"...
```

        "handle": "Totalbiscuit",
        "displayname": "TotalBiscuit",
